    <p id="about_blurb">I'm a lifelong artist originally from Boston where I got a Bachelor of Fine Arts from Mass College of Art in 2007.<br/> 
Since college I've been doing my part to make creative images standing in front of the camera, and more recently I've learned to get behind the lens too.<br/> 
I am now living in Las Vegas and looking for all sorts of artistic individuals to collaborate with.<br/>
I love glitter and candy, dirt and swords, and anything in between. Please don't hesitate to contact me with any ideas or requests.<br/>
